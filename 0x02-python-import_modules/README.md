This directory contains my answers for the 0x02. Python - import & modules Project , it also contains a 
discription for each solution i presented.

0-add.py : this script imports a function contained in a module and uses it.
1-calculation.py : this script is similar to the first one, instead of calling one function 
it calls 4 functions from the same module.
